# 🎹 Super Deluxe Synth

🔧 **Definition**  
A polyphonic software synthesizer implemented entirely in JavaScript, leveraging the Web Audio API for real-time audio synthesis. It does not use any pre-recorded audio samples, instead generating sound entirely from oscillators and gain nodes in real time.

⚠️ **Warning:** If your computer is not fast enough to run this smoothly, then you might experience increased latency and minor glitches.  
In extreme cases, you might not hear any sound if you are running out of processing power.


🧠 **Key Features**

- **Oscillator-Based Sound Generation**  
  Uses built-in waveform types (`Sine`, `Square`, `Sawtooth`, `Triangle`, `PWM`,`FM`,`AM`,`Ring Mod`) from the `OscillatorNode`.

- **Polyphony with Oscillator Pooling**  
  Supports multiple simultaneous notes (polyphony) by maintaining pools of oscillators per key.

- **ADSR Envelope (Attack/Release)**  
  Simplified envelope control using attack (`attackTime`) and release (`releaseTime`) parameters.

- **Live User Interaction**  
  Keyboard and mouse/touch input for note triggering, with sustain pedal and octave shift features.

- **Dynamic Control**  
  - Change waveform in real time  
  - Adjust master volume  
  - Shift octaves

- **Real-Time Frequency Modulation**  
  Octave shifts are applied by multiplying the base frequency using a power-of-two relationship.

- **Visual Feedback**  
  Shows which note is being played and highlights keys on interaction.

🧩 **Tech Stack**

- **Platform**: Web (runs in-browser)  
- **API**: Web Audio API  
- **UI**: HTML + CSS (assumed), interactive via DOM events  
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript

🔊 **Summary**  
A Web Audio API-based, real-time synthesizer that generates sound using oscillators without any audio samples. It supports polyphonic playback, live waveform and volume changes, and dynamic user input — all in the browser.
